# ChatBot_JS
 This project represents a comprehensive exploration of OpenAI APIs, with a primary focus on utilizing JavaScript and token-based interactions to harness the full potential of OpenAI's capabilities. The implementation involves a sophisticated approach, leveraging tokens for seamless integration with OpenAI APIs.

In this self-learning project, I've followed best practices and understood the technical challenges well. I used JavaScript, a popular and flexible programming language, to make things efficient and easy to use. The project strikes a good balance between getting things done quickly and making it accessible for others.


**How To run** 
To run this project we need to change the OpenAI token(from script.js), I have given my own token which has been deleted now(for security reasons).
